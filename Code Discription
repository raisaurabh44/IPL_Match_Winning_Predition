IPL Match Win Predictor – Detailed Summary with Logic and Workflow
==================================================================

🎯 Objective
------------
- Predict whether a team chasing a target in an IPL match will win.
- Focus is on real-time match conditions: runs left, balls left, wickets in hand, run rates.
- Useful for dashboards, analytics, and fantasy sports.

📂 Data Collection
------------------
- Matches data and ball-by-ball data were loaded.
- Purpose: capture high-level match info and granular delivery-level events.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
-------------------------------
- Removed irrelevant teams, rain-affected (DLS) matches.
- Standardized team names for consistency.

🧪 Feature Engineering
----------------------
- Merged innings data to extract target and match situation.
- Created features: runs left, balls left, wickets left, RRR, CRR.
- Focused only on second innings where chasing happens.

🏷️ Label Creation
-----------------
- Target variable: 1 if chasing team wins, 0 otherwise.

📊 Final Dataset Prep
---------------------
- Selected relevant features, removed nulls, encoded categories.

🤖 Model Training
-----------------
- Trained Logistic Regression (baseline) and Random Forest (complex model).
- Random Forest showed better performance.

📈 Evaluation
-------------
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Ensured model works well on unseen data.

💾 Model Saving
----------------
- Saved the trained model using Pickle for future use.

📌 Key Features Used
--------------------
- Runs Left, Balls Left, Wickets Left, CRR, RRR, Batting Team, Bowling Team, City.
